☕ Indian Coffee Machine (Python)

A console-based coffee machine simulation built using Python as part of my
100 Days of Code – Python learning journey.

This project simulates how a real coffee machine works by checking resources, handling payments, and serving different coffee drinks.

📌 Features

📋 Menu-driven coffee selection

☕ Multiple coffee varieties

🧂 Ingredient availability check

💰 Coin-based payment system (₹)

📊 Resource & profit report

🔁 Continuous operation until turned off

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

Dictionaries

Functions

Loops & conditionals

Basic input/output handling

▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone this repository:

git clone <your-repo-link>


Make sure main_data.py contains:

MENU (coffee details & ingredients)

resources (available ingredients)

Run the program:

python main.py

🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

The machine displays a menu of available coffees.

The user selects a coffee or requests a report.

The machine checks if enough ingredients are available.

The user inserts coins.

If payment is successful:

Ingredients are deducted

Profit is updated

Coffee is served ☕

📊 Commands

Type a coffee name to order (e.g. latte)

Type report to view machine resources

Type off to turn off the machine

🎯 Learning Outcome

This project helped me practice:

Writing modular code using functions

Working with dictionaries and nested data

Managing program state (resources & profit)

Debugging logical errors

Building confidence in problem-solving
